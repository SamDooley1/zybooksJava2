# zybooksJava2
Documenting my work as I go through CS143 (Washington state common course number) using Zybooks "CS143: Java Programming 2" textbook. If you're here for help please use this only for that and don't copy my work directly, as that won't help you in the long run. Not to mention the fact that some labs/challenge activites vary slightly anyways and I don't know how often they change course material. So since I'm taking this class in 2023 some information could've changed or might not fit your activity perfectly.
